// 151. Reverse Words in a String
// Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

// A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

// Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

// Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split("\\s+");

        // Reverse the order of the words in the list.
        int n = words.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            String temp = words[i];
            words[i] = words[n - 1 - i];
            words[n - 1 - i] = temp;
        }

        // Join the words back into a string.
        return String.join(" ", words).trim();
